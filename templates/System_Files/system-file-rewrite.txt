System File Rewrite 
---------------------

_ underscore is an alternative to . dot since flask doesn't like it for some reason...



system          = System is the System 

global          = Entire System

home_screen     = In the Home Screen 

settings_screen = In the settings_screen




Parameters: 

include = including something to OSUI 
ui      = User Interface element


For example in global: 

system_global_include_ui
