# Backend

This directory contains the PHP backend server that powers OSUI. 
It includes scripts for managing in the backend and 
runs on `localhost:30000`.

In the backend, for Smith-Pad-OS, changing the locales is powered by the user's input
in the frontend.

What is this?


This backend feature uses dependencies like playerctl and related dependencies
to display what media is playing, which is completely useful for fetching what
it is and displaying them on the frontend.
