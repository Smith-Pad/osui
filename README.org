** Experiment with Flask 

This branch is used to converting the codebase from PHP to Python with the 
Flask Framework just to see....mmm....

** Official Dependencies

- python-pip-install-install
	- flask
	- opencv-python
	- sh

** What's in the backend?

*** Adjusting Sound Volume
For adjusting the volume in the status bar, it uses PulseAudio ~pactl~


**** Decreasing Sound Volume

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -10%
#+END_SRC


**** Increasing Sound Volume

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +10%
#+END_SRC
