and not just a good looking user interface. Here are some ways it can improve accessibility:

  visual impairments to read and navigate the interface.

* Keyboard navigation: OSUI can be navigated using only a keyboard, which is helpful for users who have 
  difficulty using a mouse or other pointing device.

  **This feature will be implemented later throughout the releases**

* Customizable settings: OSUI allows users to adjust various settings such as font size, cursor size, 
  and color scheme to better suit their individual needs.
